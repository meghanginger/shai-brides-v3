        "Text": "The band recorded their first single by breaking into a nearby university and stealing an underground studio. Upon its release, ‘Joie de Vivre’ was named BBC Introducing West Midlands’ Track of the Month, with presenter Alex Noble calling the track ‘an exception… one of the strongest debuts I’ve heard on this programme.’ Noble described the group as ‘a great new experimental band to add to so many’ in the thriving West Midlands scene; Shai Brides later received airtime on BBC 6 Music as part of a segment showcasing the best of the Midlands’ up-and-coming artists."
